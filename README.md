# DLND-first-neural-network

This is the git repository for my solution to the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation assignment 1. It implements a simple neural network for bike ridership prediction based on the dataset available in the assets folder.

# Running (Linux/Mac + git + conda)

If you want to run the notebook on your own (using anaconda)
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/RomelTorres/DLND-first-neural-network.git
    cd DLND-first-neural-network
    # Create a conda environment if you want or use one you already have
    conda create --name YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3
    source activate dlnd
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
    jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

The notebook is also rendered by github, so you can simply  click on the file Your_first_neural_network.ipynb here and you will see my results.
